0. License

  The Kraken is licensed under GNU General Public License version 2.
  See COPYING.txt for details.



1. What does The Kraken do?

  The Kraken wraps around FahCore binaries and sets CPU affinity as soon
  as subsequent worker threads get created.



2. How is The Kraken useful?

  Linux scheduler(s) tend to make sub-optimal decisions as far as FahCores
  are concerned. Multinode NUMA machines are affected most; local worker
  thread's memory may get allocated (paged in) on one node but then same
  worker thread usually gets migrated to a processor on another node thus
  defeating the concept of local memory.

  The Kraken sets CPU affinity at earliest possible moment thus ensuring
  that worker threads always use local memory (same-node page-ins).



3. Supported configurations

  The Kraken is supported on modern x86-64 Linux distributions running
  Folding@Home clients 6.34 and 7.

  The Kraken supports FahCores A3 and A5. Support for other FahCores
  may be added in future, as required.

  The Kraken supports single SMP client. Multi-SMP-client configurations
  are not supported at this time.


4. Building The Kraken

4.1. Pre-requisites

    1. Make sure that (where appropriate)
       - NUMA is enabled,
       - node interleave is disabled,
       - ACPI SRAT is enabled

    2. Make sure that make and gcc are installed; on Ubuntu issue

       sudo apt-get install gcc make

    3. Make sure that all target FahCores have been downloaded
       by the client.



4.2. Building

    1. Run "make"
    2. Run "sudo make install" (or call "make install" as root)
    
    Voila. The Kraken is available in /usr/local/bin.



5. Installation

5.1. V6 client

    Stop the client. Then go to client directory and run:

      thekraken -i

    Doing so should result in something along the following:

    $ thekraken -i
    thekraken: The Kraken 0.3 (compiled Sat Apr  2 11:38:47 MDT 2011 by fah@tentacle)
    thekraken: Processor affinity wrapper for Folding@Home
    thekraken: The Kraken comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; licensed under GPLv2
    thekraken: performing installation to .
    thekraken: /home/fah/fah-6.34/FahCore_a3.exe: wrapper succesfully installed
    thekraken: /home/fah/fah-6.34/FahCore_a5.exe: wrapper succesfully installed
    thekraken: finished installation, 2 out of 2 files processed
    $ 

    Re-start the client.



5.2. V7 client

    Stop the client. Run:

      sudo thekraken -i /var/lib/fahclient/cores

    Alternatively, run "thekraken -i /var/lib/fahclient/cores" as root.

    Doing so should result in something along the following:

    $ sudo thekraken -i /var/lib/fahclient/cores/
    thekraken: The Kraken 0.3 (compiled Sat Apr  2 11:38:47 MDT 2011 by fah@tentacle)
    thekraken: Processor affinity wrapper for Folding@Home
    thekraken: The Kraken comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; licensed under GPLv2
    thekraken: performing installation to /var/lib/fahclient/cores/
    thekraken: descend into /var/lib/fahclient/cores/www.stanford.edu and all other subdirectories [Y/n]?

    If path appears correct, confirm with "y" and press Enter. This should result
    in something along the following:
    
    thekraken: /var/lib/fahclient/cores/www.stanford.edu/~pande/Linux/AMD64/Core_a3.fah/FahCore_a3: wrapper succesfully installed
    thekraken: /var/lib/fahclient/cores/www.stanford.edu/~pande/Linux/AMD64/beta/Core_a3.fah/FahCore_a3: wrapper succesfully installed
    thekraken: finished installation, 2 out of 2 files processed
    $ 

    Re-start the client.



6. How do I know it's working?

    While folding, run:
   
      for i in $(ps -L auxw | grep FahCo  | awk '{ if ($4 > 10) print $3 }' | sort -n -k1,1) ; do taskset -pc $i  ; done

    Doing so should give you sequential processor numbers starting with 0 in its
    output, i.e.:

    pid 41666's current affinity list: 0
    pid 41669's current affinity list: 1
    pid 41670's current affinity list: 2

    pid 41714's current affinity list: 46
    pid 41715's current affinity list: 47

   
   
7. Know issues and caveats

    CAUTION: FahCore_a5 is known to be problematic at user-induced shutdowns*.
             To be on a safe side make a backup of complete client directory
             before hitting Ctrl+C!

    To tell whether checkpoint was written correctly check the size
    of work/wudata_XX.ckp file (XX being current slot number).
    It should be 75160 (for core A5). If it's not -- better switch to backed up
    directory.

    CAUTION: The Kraken may produce sub-optimal results
             with nodes with no memory installed.
